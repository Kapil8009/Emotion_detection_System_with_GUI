# 😊 Emotion Detection System with GUI

## 🧠 Overview

The **Emotion Detection System with GUI** is a machine learning–based application designed to identify human emotions from facial expressions in real time or from uploaded images. The system leverages **deep learning and computer vision** techniques to accurately classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality.

With an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, users can easily interact with the system — uploading photos, capturing live video frames, and viewing detected emotions instantly.

## 🚀 Features

* 🖼️ **Image & Webcam Support:** Detect emotions from images or live camera feed.
* 💡 **Deep Learning Model:** Trained using a large dataset of facial images representing various emotions.
* 🎯 **High Accuracy:** Learns subtle facial expressions for improved performance.
* 🧩 **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter (or PyQt, if used) for smooth user experience.
* ⚡ **Real-Time Prediction:** Fast and responsive emotion detection results.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * OpenCV (for image processing)
  * TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning model)
  * NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
  * Tkinter / PyQt (for GUI)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained using a **large collection of facial expression images** covering multiple emotion categories. The dataset was preprocessed — including face detection, normalization, and augmentation — to improve the model’s generalization and robustness.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Emotion-Detection-System.git
   cd Emotion-Detection-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The system captures an image (from file or webcam).
2. The trained deep learning model processes the image to detect facial features.
3. It classifies the detected emotion and displays it on the GUI in real-time.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Support for multiple faces in a single frame.
* Integration with speech emotion recognition.
* Improved accuracy using transfer learning and larger datasets.
* Deployment as a web application.
